# FappyClone
This is a Flappy Bird Clone called Flappy Ave,shoutouts to http://www.dafont.com/pacifico.font for the font used in the game.
All the art work is orginal, the Bird is almost the same as the original but with a different color scheme. 
Clion was used to compile and make this program.
To play use up or down for selection on main menu and press enter. Press space to flap the birds wings. There are 7ll levels in the game.
Game play is consistent everytime with no random feature.
